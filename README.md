I have icebox'd this project. Desktop apps are not my jam, and working with
outdated and possibly unmaintained frameworks like electron-vue just leads to
outdated and insecure dependencies, and an inability to use third-party
packages with reasonably modern and up-to-date requirements.

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
yarn dev

# build electron application for production
yarn build

# run unit & end-to-end tests
yarn test

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
yarn lint

```
